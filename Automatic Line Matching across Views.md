# Automatic Line Matching across Views
_by Cordelia Schmid and Andrew Zisserman from Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford in 1999_

## short range motion
This is the image motion that arises in image sequences where simple nearest neighbour tracking would almost work. 

## long range motion
This is the image motionthatarises between views from a stereo rig, where the baseline is signiÔ¨Åcant(compared to the distance to the scene).

## Line detector
**Canny edge detector**

## F-guided matching
inspired by epipolar constraint. __F__ is the fundamental matrix.
